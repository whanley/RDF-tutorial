# Summary

Programming Historian contains an introductory [tutorial on OpenRefine](/cleaning-data-with-openrefine). If you are not already using OpenRefine, complete that lesson before begining this lesson.

### Links

Create [a link to *Programming Historian*](/) using the format in this sentence. Ensure linked phrases are semantically meaningful. Do not link terms that are meaningful only to sighted users such as "click here".

### Inserting Images:

Copy this short-code to insert an image. Replace words in all caps with your image information (eg, Figure1.jpg). Captions should include sequential image numbering (eg "Figure 1: ..."). 

{% include figure.html filename="IMAGE-FILENAME" caption="CAPTION TO IMAGE" %}

### Alerts and Warnings

If you want to include an aside or a warning to readers, you can set it apart from the main text:

<div class="alert alert-warning">
 Be sure that you follow directions carefully!
</div>

It will appear in a coloured box and can be useful for drawing attention to particular warnings.

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

| Heading 1 | Heading 2 | Heading 3 |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Row 1, column 1 | Row 1, column 2 | Row 1, column 3|

| Row 3, column 1 | Row 3, column 2 | Row 3, column 3|
</div>
Table 1: This table contains...
